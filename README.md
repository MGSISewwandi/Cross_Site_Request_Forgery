# Cross_Site_Request_Forgery
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application against which they are currently authenticated. CSRF attacks exploit the trust a Web application has in an authenticated user. 

A CSRF attack exploits a vulnerability in a Web application if it cannot differentiate between a request generated by an individual user and a request generated by a user without their consent.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101270271/195639836-ebd9f3cf-9f87-4d83-824e-6f7094798ba7.png)

In a successful CSRF attack, the attacker causes the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally. Examples include:
-Submitting or deleting a record.
-Submitting a transaction.
-Purchasing a product.
-Changing a password or Email.
-Sending a message.

Depending on the nature of the action, the attacker might be able to gain full control over the user's account. 

For a CSRF attack to be possible, consider the three key conditions following:
-A relevant action
-Cookie-based session handling 
-No unpredictable request parameters

How to Prevent CSRF Vulnerabilities ??

1Primary Defense 
	Use a CSRF token in relevant requests. 

2.Additional Defense
	Use of SameSite cookies 

3.Inadequate Defense 
	Use of Referer header

The most robust way to defend against CSRF attacks is to include a CSRF TOKEN (anti â€“ CSRF token) within relevant requests.
 The token should be: 
-Secret
-Unpredictable
-Unique to the user session


CSRF Token works as follows:
-The web server generates a token and stores it.
-The token is statically set as a hidden field of the form.
-The form is submitted by the user.
-The token is included in the POST request data.
-The application compares the token generated and stored by the application with the token sent in the request.
-If these tokens match, the request is valid.
-If these tokens do not match, the request is invalid and is rejected.
